# 👨‍🌾Krishika
**West Bengal** is predominantly an agrarian State. There are 71.23 lakh farm families of whom 96% are small and marginal farmers(the ones who have less than 1 and upto 2 hectares of land). One of the major problem faced by the farmers is small and fragmented land-holdings. The land belonging to the father is equally distributed among his sons making the land into smaller and smaller fragments (**fragmentation**) with each generation. This makes it very difficult for farmers to generate bulk produce and sell it at the mandis. Here comes the role of a middle man who buys produces from multiple farmers at a very low price and sells them at the mandis. Thus the farmers are left with very less profit. The only solution to this problem is the **reallocation of holdings which are fragmented**, by **collective selling**. Our site provides a platform for the farmers to collaborate and sell collectively so that they can make atleast 90% of the MSP(Minimum Support Price). Earlier they could make hardly 40% of it. 


# 🌾 Product Offerings

- 💬 FORUM: farmers can post about their crop details and fellow farmers can comment on that post to collaborate by availing the group formation feature.

- 💸 MANDI: Here, farmers can search by their districts and our site will show the nearest mandi locations on google map where they can go and sell their crops(after forming the groups).

- 💼 VAULT SYSTEM: when farmers will form groups, they can see how much more crop contribution is needed so that it can be called a bulk that is eligible to sell in the mandis.

- 🗣️ BILINGUAL: Our entire site is available in both english and bengali. keeping in mind our target audience(i.e, the farmers), our site has very simple UI, with everything explained in bengali and it is available in mobile version.
